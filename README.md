## Knonw Issues
The following is a list of known issues in PhotoTrek that the development team was unable to fix due to time constraints or uncertainty about how to fix: 
- Album cover photo issues: Some unexpected behaviour can occur when editing which album a photo belongs to. In some cases, moving a photo to an album with no photos currently in it will result in the cover image not being updated in the destination album. The cover image is supposed to be the most recent photo added to that album, but when moving photos into and out of empty albums it will not be updated. 

- Map refreshing: When deleting a photo and then going back to the full map view, the marker for that photo will still be present and clickable by the user. If the user clicks on this marker, they will receive an error message via a Toast. This marker will only disappear after the map activity has been restarted or refreshed using the floating action button.
